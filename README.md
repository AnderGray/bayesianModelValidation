# bayesianModelValidation

Code for performing Bayesian calibation using prior conjugates and area metric for stochastic distance between data and prediction.

As shown in ICASP13 conferance paper "Towards a Bayesian framework for model validation"

areaMetric.m is an impletementation of the areaMetric
and bayesValida.m is a script which defines an uncertain test function with uncertain experimental data, and updates a validation distribution


bayesValida.m and AreaMetric.m are used to create the plots used in the paper.
